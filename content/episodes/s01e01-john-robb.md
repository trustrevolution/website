summary: |
  What happens when trust—the glue holding society together—starts to crumble under the weight of AI, decentralized networks, and political swarms? In the premier episode of Trust Revolution, host Shawn Yeager sits down with John Robb, a former Special Ops officer turned tech visionary, to explore this question. With a career spanning the battlefield and Silicon Valley, Robb offers sharp insights into how "red" and "blue" network swarms are reshaping U.S. politics, how AI-driven augmented reality might disconnect us from reality, and how social AIs could spark the next economic revolution. From the fertility crisis to the future of decentralized systems, this conversation unpacks the challenges and opportunities in a world where trust is increasingly fragile.

  John Robb is a US Air Force Academy graduate, a former Special Ops officer, and a tech entrepreneur. He founded Gomez and served as CEO of Userland Software, a key player in the development of RSS technology. Robb is also the author of Brave New War and a leading strategist focused on decentralized systems and artificial intelligence.
