summary: |
  “Bitcoin exists to remove intermediaries from the movement of money online. Without privacy, if someone can see how money is moving, they don't like someone you paid, they can discriminate based on that.” — Dan Gould

  Dan Gould builds PayJoin, the privacy protocol that breaks Bitcoin surveillance while cutting transaction fees up to 25%. Satoshi flagged Bitcoin's privacy problem in the white paper—PayJoin solves it without mixing, turning surveillance assumptions into dead ends. When privacy becomes an economic benefit rather than a cost, adoption follows.

  bio: "Dan Gould leads the Payjoin Foundation, a nonprofit launched in August 2025 to advance Bitcoin privacy through practical, fee-reducing technology. Based in Taipei, he's the architect behind Payjoin Dev Kit (PDK)—open-source infrastructure that lets any wallet or exchange integrate privacy-preserving transactions. He won the Human Rights Foundation's bounty for Payjoin V2 by eliminating the server requirement that made earlier implementations vulnerable to censorship."
