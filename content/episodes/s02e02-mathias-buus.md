description: "Mathias Buus, CEO of Holepunch, on revolutionizing the internet with peer-to-peer technologies."
summary: "Mathias Buus, CEO of Holepunch, discusses revolutionizing the internet with peer-to-peer technologies like Pear Runtime, Hypercore, and Keet. He shares his journey from math student to open-source powerhouse with over 1,000 NPM modules, driven by empowering individuals. They explore centralized platforms' flaws—data control, censorship, and erosion of sovereignty—and how P2P technologies offer a trustless alternative. Mathias addresses Keet's partial open-sourcing controversy and lays out a vision for a world of borderless, sovereign communication via owned devices. For businesses, the path forward starts with deprogramming centralization assumptions, experimenting with hybrid models, and building sustainable decentralized systems."
